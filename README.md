**Over 30 recipes for implementing deep neural networks in Python**

## What is this book about?

Keras has quickly emerged as a popular deep learning library. Written in Python, it allows you to train convolutional as well as recurrent neural networks with speed and accuracy.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install and configure Keras in TensorFlow
* Master neural network programming using the Keras library 
* Understand the different Keras layers 
* Use Keras to implement simple feed-forward neural networks, CNNs and RNNs
* Work with various datasets and models used for image and text classification

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
stories = list()
for i, text in enumerate(clean_texts):
stories.append({'story': text, 'highlights': clean_summaries[i]})

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

Keras Deep Learning Cookbook is for you if you are a data scientist or machine learning expert who wants to find practical solutions to common problems encountered while training deep learning models.
